							<h1>Haverford Libraries Website Redesign</a></h1>
							<p class="major">Moving from static pages to a content management system, Haverford College Libraries had the opportunity to completely reimagine our digital presence. I collaborated with other members of the redesign committee to use UX design principles and practices to deliver a new site with a more intentional design and organization.</p>

							<h3>Challenge</h3>
							<p>Survey responses from students and faculty, our primary users, indicated that the pre-redesign site for the Libraries was sometimes confusing and difficult to navigate. We also learned that some users felt that the site used confusing or unclear language.
							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p>We collected survey data to find specific pain points on the existing site. We also learned that a large number of users came to the existing site for quick reference, not deeper engagement with library research services. Because the institution is a small community, many users preferred in-person engagement with library services. We created user personas for students and faculty of various needs and backgrounds. We did <strong>card sorting</strong> exercises, created <strong>wireframes</strong> for various sections of the library site, and created an interactive <strong>prototype</strong> based on the information we had gathered. We conducted user testing on the prototypes before moving forward with site development.
							<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
							<p>For most of us, this was our first foray into digital user experience. The success of the redesigned site illuminated how effective creating <strong>user personas</strong>, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing on those prototypes are in building a website that meets user needs. After this experience, I began teaching regular <strong>workshops</strong> (this <a href="images/ux_ui_design_slides.pdf" target="_blank">slide deck</a> is one example from a brief pre-Hackathon workshop for students) on these practices to introduce them to our campus.</p>

							<h2>Result</h2>
							<p>We launched a redesigned site for the Libraries on time and to positive reception. Users expressed happiness with the organization and visuals of the new site. This project was also my introduction to UX design, research, and strategy, and demonstrated the effectiveness of these practices in meeting user needs.</p>
