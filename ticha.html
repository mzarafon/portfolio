							<p class="major"><em><a href="https://ticha.haverford.edu/" target="_blank">Ticha</a></em> is a resource for Zapotec, an endangered family of indigenous languages spoken in the region of Oaxaca, Mexico. The Ticha website contains several hundred historical manuscripts from the Central Valley of Oaxaca, as well as transcribed and encoded digital editions of some of the earliest printed texts in the Americas. The project team is an ever-growing and changing group of collaborators that includes linguists, ethnohistorians, language activists, students, and technologists, as well as a Zapotec advisory board.</p>

							<h3>Challenge</h3>
							<p>At a Zapotec language workshop for high school students in Tlacolula, we experienced  unanticipated disruptions to the network connection. This prevented students from accessing the necessary texts through the web application on their devices.</p>
							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p>In close collaboration with the project team, I led student developers in building a PDF export feature for the web application. The PDF export includes digital surrogates of the manuscripts as well as plain-text transcription. This feature enables us to circulate the corpus via the web application or a thumb drive (or other file transfer means) within the stakeholding community, and helps us fulfill teaching and access goals for the project.</p>
							<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
							<p>We now seek to create similar static outputs for most web-based projects. The project team also applied this philosophy to a web publication of teaching modules based on the corpus as well. I have since configured a digital publishing platform (Presbooks) that exports web content into static formats including PDF, EPUB, and Kindle (Mobi) for all digital publications in our library.</p>

							<h3>Challenge</h3>
							<p>Despite a request from Zapotec community members for a way to transcribe the manuscripts on the <em>Ticha</em> site, the rate at which documents were transcribed was lower than expected. Users would often transcribe for a short while, and then leave the site. We initially chose a transcription tool that had an approval mechanism for quality control out of the box.</p>
							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p>We surveyed community members on our document transcription feature. The users felt that their contributions went into a "black box" once submitted through the public interface. The submissions went into the approval queue, but this had the unintended effect of discouraging further engagement. I worked with project team members and student developers to create a custom transcription feature that stored a “last approved transcription” that we could easily restore if needed. With the new transcriber, users could see their contributions on the site immediately after submitting. I helped initiate another round of user feedback and learned that this adjustment made transcribers feel more satisfied in their work, more a part of the project team, and more likely to transcribe additional manuscripts.</p>
							<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
							<p>Immediate feedback from the web application drives further and deeper engagement with this user group. We are now taking a similar approach to other processes, including the encoding of texts for language and format. This work is primarily done by college students in the classroom. I co-designed a survey of students who overwhelmingly reported encouragement and satisfaction from seeing their work immediately visibile on the website.</p>

							<h2>Result</h2>
							<p><em>Ticha</em> is a flagship project for the Libraries’ Digital Scholarship program that has won multiple awards, advanced strategic goals of the College in experiential learning and global citizenship, and has created a global network of language activists and scholars. I work closely and continuously with project team members and community users to iterate on our project design for an improved user experience.</p>
