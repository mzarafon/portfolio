							<p class="major">Hundreds of thousands of Guatemalans were forcibly disappeared or murdered by the state during the nation’s civil war that spanned more than three decades between 1960 and 1996. The <em><a href="https://grupodeapoyomutuo.org.gt/" target="_blank">Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo (GAM)</a></em> is a human rights organization based in Guatemala City that seeks justice for and remembrance of the disappeared. Out of concern for the safety of their physical records, which include <em>denuncios</em>--declarations of disappeared loved ones--the GAM engaged Haverford Libraries and the Digital Scholarship program to help create a digital archive of their materials. Along with digitized collections, the project team seeks to generate research data, visualizations, and valuable historical context in this ongoing partnership. Our project team includes librarians, faculty, students, and members of the <em>GAM</em>.</p>

							<h2>Goals</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Facilitate access to a one-of-a-kind digital collection to shape public memory of the Guatemalan Civil War</li>
								<li>Digitize the collection of <em>denuncios</em> as a means of preserving the knowledge and stories within the collection</li>
								<li>Foster a long-term relationship between Haverford students, Libraries staff, and the <em>GAM</em></li>
								<li>Create new relationships with college students in Guatemala, and engage scholars whose research would benefit from access to these materials</li>

							<h3>Challenge</h3>
							<p>Design a simple digitization workflow that ensures the chain of custody for digital assets remains intact for use in court in the prosecution of human rights violations.</p>
							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p>We consulted with the college archivist to implement the BagIt standard for file transfers before ingesting them into the project's web application, preserving timestamps and scanning event metadata so that the veracity of the digital objects can be confirmed in a court of law. We worked closely with all project members to design and implement workflows for digitization and description, even shipping equipment to the <em>GAM</em> offices in Guatemala City to aid the scanning process. We produced extensive documentation for digitization procedures so that members of the <em>GAM</em> could train additional office staff in scanning and description.</p>
							<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
							<p>Collaboration and an iterative approach can ensure that project goals and user needs are met, while also creating opportunities to build capacity in new areas. As we worked with the <em>GAM</em> on the digitization workflow, we documented our processes so that we maintained capacity for future postcustodial projects. This is now a service that we can offer our users in the library upon request.</p>

							<h3>Challenge</h3>
							<p>When we began this project, neither Haverford Libraries nor <em>GAM</em> staff had detailed knowledge of the contents of the <em>denuncios</em>, as the documents had mostly been stored in boxes or bags in a storage room. We were forced to reconsider our initial plans for a fully open and public digital collection once we saw more of the materials. The documents contained an abundance of personal information of survivors (addresses, phone numbers, etc.), requiring us to rethink our approach to the public access layer.</p>
							<h3>Solution</h3>
							<p>We held a series of discussions with partners from the <em>GAM</em>, who had in turn engaged with family members of the disappeared around their comfort with a fully open digital collection. Many family members expressed concern for their safety or ongoing pain from the disappearance of their loved ones, so we designed and built an authentication layer and access protocol, managed by our partners, to limit the visibility the full collection. The public access layer only contains case files to which the family of the disappeared consented to their opening.</p>
							<h3>Lessons learned</h3>
							<p>The opening of collections of such importance also have the potential to extend trauma and suffering. While the <em>GAM</em> and Haverford Libraries seek justice through the creation of this collection, the emotional and physical well-being of those who lived through the Guatemalan Civil War must guide the project team in its work. By centering the mission of our partner organization and engaging with their communities, we can ensure that we do not do harm while still fulfilling project goals related to research and scholarship.</p>

							<h2>Result</h2>
							<p>Our team collaboratively built and maintains a multifaceted web presence with a <a href="https://archivogam.haverford.edu/en/acceso/" target="_blank">public access layer</a> and limited-access research application. Our library’s partnership with the <em>GAM</em> is ongoing and expanding to other institutions (the University of Delaware, Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala). The <em>GAM</em>’s director was named to the UNESCO Memory of the World National Committee for Guatemala in 2020 as a result of this work. The public access application was also featured in an exhibit the Museum of Memory and Tolerance in Mexico City. We have sent several Haverford students to Guatemala City to conduct research and build relationships with the <em>GAM</em>. This strategic partnership has advanced public memory and justice goals for the <em>GAM</em> while also furthering experiential learning, collection development, and global citizenship priorities for Haverford College.</p>
